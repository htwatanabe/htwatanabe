# Hi there! 👋

I'm Hitoyuki. Nice to meet you!

👨‍💻 I'm a Backend Engineer originally from Japan, currently calling Australia home. My journey led me here to be with my partner and explore exciting new opportunities in the tech landscape.

🚀 While my expertise lies in Backend Development, I'm actively honing my frontend skills, diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.js, with a goal of mastering Full-Stack Development.

💡 I thrive on collaboration and learning from fellow engineers. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals to exchange insights, engage in friendly competition, and grow together professionally.

Let's connect and code our way to success! 🌟
